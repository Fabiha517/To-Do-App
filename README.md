What I learned

While working on this project, I reinforced my understanding of DOM manipulation with JavaScript, especially for:

Dynamically creating and appending tasks

Managing task states (active, completed, deleted)

Using classList for toggling themes and task styles

Implementing drag and drop functionality

Example:

task.addEventListener('dragstart', () => {
  task.classList.add('dragging');
});


This project also helped me understand how to structure code for better readability and maintainability.

Continued development

In future projects, Iâ€™d like to:

Improve drag-and-drop handling for smoother user experience

Store todos in localStorage so they persist after refresh

Explore frameworks like React to handle state management more efficiently
